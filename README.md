# Bittbot

Bittbot starts as a fork and massive refactor of [Pobot by xcbtrader](https://github.com/xcbtrader/pobot) to extend it to Bittrex,
since the code base of Pobot was not maintainable.

Bittbot then started adding new features and strategies to further power it up as a full featured, automatic cryptocurrency trader
for Poloniex and Bittrex.

## Currently Bittbot features:

1. Advanced strategies
2. Easy configuration generator with live-data
3. Telegram bot

## Strategies:
* Automatic trading using market increments
* Automatic trading using Bollinger Bands
* Automatic trading using MACD + RSI
* Automatic trading using last 24h increments
